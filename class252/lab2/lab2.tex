\section{Personal History}
    My first girlfriend was met on a train. She was “asked” as a girlfriend by someone. In China, many parents would ask about their children's marriage during the holidays and that is actually very painful.
Therefore, the best way to shut them up is to have a family dinner with the so-called "girlfriend". Such like this little favor is usually helped by classmates or friends, so nothing would happen. However the person who asked the girl did not expect that the train drove very slowly. The girl was next to me, so we talked for 15 hours. In the end, the girl canceled the origin appointment and went back to my hometown with me for dinner and met my parents.
