NOTE: For all assignments, you are not allowed to modify the type signatures of the functions.

Part 1)
Navigate to http://codecheck.it/files/1801270115e7z5z5wxbxeqdep0nhqg29hic.
Implement the maxNum function.  This function reads in a list of numbers and returns the largest.  Define this function in a recursive manner. (Note that using the max function is cheating).

Once you have passed all tests, click the "Download Report" button.


Part 2)
Implement the "fizzbuzz" game.  The function counts from 1 to the specified number, returning a string with the result.  The rules are:

    If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5, instead say "fizzbuzz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 3, instead say "fizz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 5, instead say "buzz"
    Otherwise say the number

Here is a sample run of this function:

*Main> fizzbuzz 15
"1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz"

Part 3)
Go to http://codecheck.it/files/1801270120a4iwu1xmznyiyliwjqj9akxcl.

In JSON.hs, implement the JObject case of the toString function.



SUBMITTING YOUR WORK

Once you have completed all three problems, you should have generated three different .zip files from CodeCheck.  Zip those .zip files together, and upload the resulting .zip file to Canvas.
