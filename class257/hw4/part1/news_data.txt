Sir John Holmes is understood to have been told by MPs that he cannot continue in the role \u2013 after seeking to extend his four-year term beyond December. The Electoral Commission is also now shelving plans to acquire powers to prosecute scores of criminal offences itself, rather than referring suspected breaches to the police and Crown Prosecution Service. It comes after the Conservatives raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the leadership and accountability of the watchdog, over the proposals, which Amanda Milling, the party chairman, said would have amounted to the body \u201cmarking its own homework\u201d. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph in August, Ms Milling said: \u201cThe commission should be focusing on improving its core functions, not trying to expand its empire. If the commission fails to make these changes and do the job it was set up to do then the only option would be to abolish it.\u201d This weekend, a commission spokesman said the body had \u201cpaused\u201d the move, stating that \u201cwe do not currently have broad stakeholder understanding and consent\u201d. Sir John, who has chaired the commission since 2017, faced criticism when this newspaper revealed in 2018 that, months after being nominated as the body\u2019s chairman, he said in a speech that he \u201cregret[ted] the result\u201d of the 2016 Brexit referendum and complained about \u201cthe panoply of Eurosceptic nonsense about the EU\u201d heard during the campaign. Brexiteers have repeatedly accused the commission of bias against pro-Leave campaigners. Sir John is understood to have informed the Speaker\u2019s committee on the Electoral Commission, which oversees the body, that he wished to continue in his role beyond the initial four-year term. His predecessor, Jenny Watson, served for two terms, totalling eight years. But the former civil servant\u2019s request was turned down after members of the panel concluded that \u201call is not well\u201d at the commission, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Last week, the committee began the process of appointing a replacement, with a public recruitment campaign expected to begin shortly. Under the Political Parties and Elections Act, the chairman cannot be a member of a political party, or anyone who has served as an MP or donated to a party in the last five years. Sir John gave the commissioners\u2019 endorsement to the push by Bob Posner, the body\u2019s chief executive, to hand itself powers to prosecute parties and campaign groups \u2013 now \u201cpaused\u201d. A spokesman for the commission said: \u201cWe thank him for his leadership of and commitment to the commission over the past four years and for all his work in support of the UK\u2019s democratic processes.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cWe planned to consult later this year on changes to our enforcement policy, which would have included a draft prosecution policy. However, while we have had positive discussions with a range of stakeholders, we do not currently have broad stakeholder understanding and consent. \u201cWe hope to build consensus in due course, but our current focus is to work to prepare for the polls taking place next May, to ensure that these elections can be delivered safely and effectively. We have therefore paused this work.\u201d<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/chairman-election-watchdog-forced-211257047.html","pubDate":"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 17:12:57 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"chairman-election-watchdog-forced-211257047.html","hash":"b6a562b66811f267e800177fcaca7432","timestamp":1601730777}

In an interview with The Telegraph, Douglas Ross said the UK&#39;s fishing industry did not yet have the &quot;capacity&quot; to reap the full benefits of leaving the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of this year. Mr Ross&#39;s remarks came after Nigel Farage accused Boris Johnson of &quot;backing down&quot; on fish in the post-Brexit trade talks. On Sunday, Mr Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president agreed to &quot;intensify&quot; negotiations this week. In a joint statement the two sides said that &quot;progress had been made in recent weeks&quot; but that &quot;significant gaps remained&quot;, including on the issue of fishing rights in UK waters. Mr Johnson is understood to have insisted that the UK was prepared to end the post-Brexit transition period without a formal trade agreement, as he warned that time was short to agree a deal. The UK has said it needs &quot;clarity&quot; by Oct 15 on whether a deal is possible. Last week it emerged that the UK had proposed a new three-year transition period for fisheries, in a bid to help unlock the talks. Over the course of the three-year period, the catches of EU fishermen would be gradually reduced before the implementation of new quotas.<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/exclusive-british-fishermen-unprepared-full-162213951.html","pubDate":"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 12:22:13 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"exclusive-british-fishermen-unprepared-full-162213951.html","hash":"4d78db9a60d071eb39ab3945b898e866","timestamp":1601713333}

Tavares was on track to open in late January when the Covid-19 outbreak in China brought tourism to a standstill, disrupting plans and pushing back the opening of the 150-seat outlet by nearly a year to December.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.Tavares&#39; predicament and those linked to the city&#39;s tourism industry show that Macau&#39;s reliance on gaming, tourism and affiliated services is hurting its economy as it accounted for 70 per cent of its revenues in the first eight months of this year.Macau needs to move quickly to diversify its economy to provide new job opportunities and income sources for its growing population, especially in light of the havoc wrecked to its mainstay tourism industry by the coronavirus pandemic, say analysts and veteran businessmen.Just before the Covid-19 pandemic derailed the city&#39;s economy, Beijing announced a raft of policies in December last year aimed at diversifying Macau&#39;s economy and forging closer integration with the Greater Bay Area by building its financial services industry, while maintaining its position as a leading gaming and tourism centre.President Xi Jinping, during his three-day visit to Macau in December last year to mark the 20th anniversary of its return from Portuguese to Chinese rule, backed the city to develop into a service platform for commercial and trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Xi also urged Macau to seize the opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and Greater Bay Area projects.Chinese President Xi Jinping gives a speech in Macau to celebrate the 20-year anniversary of the former Portuguese colony&#39;s return to Chinese rule, on December 20, 2019.

Photo: BloombergMacau government projections show by 2040 the population is expected to increase by 18 per cent to 808,000 from 685,400 at present. This means the government has to act fast to maintain its per capita GDP of US$84,096, one of the world&#39;s highest, according to 2019 World Bank data.&quot;The upcoming retendering of the six casino concessionaires would be crucial to the development of Macau and take it to the next level,&quot; Allan Zeman, non-executive chairman at Wynn Macau, told the Post in an interview late last month.All six casino licence holders - Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts and Wynn Resorts from the US, Melco International Development and Galaxy Entertainment from Hong Kong, and Macau-based SJM Holdings, the gaming business of the late &quot;King of Gambling&quot; Stanley Ho - will see their concessions expire in June 2022. Macau hotels report rise in bookings for golden week holiday&quot;Gaming operators are looking at and working on [new projects],&quot; said Zeman. However, he added that the gaming operators are reluctant to commit wholeheartedly as there has been no word from the government on their licence renewal.&quot;I think once there is a green light, they will move forward,&quot; said Zeman, who is best known as the founder of Lan Kwai Fong, Hong Kong&#39;s nightlife district.Industry experts have long been critical of existing casino operators&#39; heavily reliance on high rollers from mainland China, with visitors from China accounting for more than 70 per cent of Macau&#39;s tourists.At present, nearly 80 to 90 per cent of the gaming revenue comes from the mainland, said Ben Lee, managing partner at IGamiX Management and Consulting. &quot;I don&#39;t think this is what the government intended to achieve when it opened up the casino monopoly [in 2001],&quot; he said, adding that the Macau government planned on it being more like Las Vegas, as an international tourism centre.Zeman, however, said that it was natural for Macau to get most of its visitors from China because of its proximity, 1.4 billion population and status as the only place outside the mainland where gambling is legal.He said that Las Vegas first started off with a focus on gambling for many years and eventually brought some top entertainment shows to its hotels to become a leading international tourism and gaming destination. He added that Macau has gone through a similar phase, and as the world&#39;s top gaming centre it now has the platform to become the world&#39;s No 1 entertainment centre by bringing the biggest names in the music industry and host major international sports events.Allan Zeman, chairman of the board at Wynn Macau, said the company is in the process of diversifying its entertainment offerings.

In the first nine months of the year, the sector&#39;s revenue fell 82 per cent to 38.6 billion patacas (US$4.8 billion), from 220.29 billion patacas a year ago, according to official data. Even the VIP segment which accounts for half of the sector&#39;s revenues, saw a 77 per cent decline in the first two quarters of the year, compared to a year earlier.This was inevitable considering tourist arrivals in Macau, whose historic city centre is a Unesco World Heritage Site, have tumbled 87 per cent to 3.57 million in the first eight months of the year because of border restrictions to prevent the spread of Covid-19, official figures show.As a result Macau&#39;s gross domestic product sank by 67.8 per cent year on year in the second quarter of 2020, the Statistics and Census Service said. As has been the case with economies around the world, the Macau government stepped in to help businesses and households affected by the Covid-19-induced downturn.&quot;With tourism being one of Macau&#39;s core economic pillars, the Macau government came up with financial stimulus packages, providing tax breaks and cash aid to affected companies and households as well as affected industries and employers to help revitalise the hard-hit economy,&quot; said Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of Macau&#39;s tourism office in a written reply.Carlos Siu Lam, associate professor at Centre for Gaming and Tourism Studies of Macao Polytechnic Institute, said that Macau should reduce its reliance on VIP gamers and expand its non-gaming offerings. &quot;With increased emphasis on the non-gaming sector, Macau will be able to draw different types of tourists, from young couples to families and even retirees,&quot; he said.Ho Iat-seng, Chief Executive of Macau, reiterated plans for a proposed stock exchange in the city during his policy address in April.

Photo: XinhuaMacau&#39;s other much-publicised economic diversification plans include launching a Nasdaq-like stock exchange, which would offer another alternative destination for start-ups in the bay area to raise capital, and tap into the fundraising needs of the Portuguese-speaking world to which Macau belongs. China&#39;s first-quarter trade with Lusophone countries reached US$31.97 billion, government data showed.In June, the Chinese government announced a plan to introduce a wealth management connect scheme which includes Macau financial firms. The scheme, which is yet to have a launch date, will allow bay area residents to buy investment products via banks in Hong Kong and Macau, while residents of Hong Kong and Macau can also invest in mainland investment products sold by the mainland banks.Similarly, there has not been much progress since last October when the Monetary Authority of Macau said it was conducting a feasibility study to establish a securities exchange. Besides, it has to compete with two established stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, which have about 4,700 listed companies and a combined market value of about US$10 trillion.Tourists at the ruins of St Paul&#39;s in Macau.

The city&#39;s tourism industry has taken a huge hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. Photo: Nora TamMacau&#39;s Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng reiterated those plans in his policy address in April, saying the city is exploring ways to introduce a yuan-trading stock exchange and further develop its insurance and banking system. &quot;Macau and Guangdong would also look at the feasibility of building an international trade centre serving China and Portuguese-speaking countries to further their economic and trade ties,&quot; Ho added.The proposed Macau exchange will first focus on bond trading, Benjamin Chan Sau-san, chairman of Monetary Authority of Macau, the de facto central bank, said last year.How quickly the Macau government moves to implement the plan remains to be seen.&quot;Bond market makes sense for Macau, not a stock exchange, as it would not be competing with neighbouring stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen,&quot; said Patrick Rozario, managing director of accounting and advisory firm Moore Hong Kong, whose family is from Macau.The use of the yuan in Macau has grown substantially over the past one year, with cross border yuan trade settlement surging 23 per cent last year to 2.58 trillion yuan (US$378.44 billion) while yuan deposits rose 4 per cent to 55.97 billion patacas (US$7 billion), according to Monetary Authority of Macao data.Clement Chan, managing director of BDO, summed up Macau&#39;s predicament, saying the long-term success of Macau&#39;s diversification plan depends on whether it can define a role for itself as an offshore yuan trading centre and complement the two existing exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.&quot;It is a matter of finding a niche,&quot; he said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The Prime Minister and Ursula von der Leyen will hold their first conference call on Brexit since June \u201cto take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps,\u201d a Number 10 spokesman said. News of the video conference call came as the last scheduled round of UK-EU trade negotiations ended in Brussels. The pound rose by as much 0.5 percent on the hopes it would bring a breakthrough. &quot;Where there is a will, there is a way so I think we should intensify the negotiations,&quot; said Mrs von der Leyen, who will put the prime minister under pressure to soften the British position on access to UK waters after the end of the Brexit transition period. Mrs von der Leyen on Friday said neither side could afford no deal during the coronavirus pandemic. But she demanded concessions over level playing field commitments on state aid laws and the enforcement of the trade deal. She wants a stricter system of enforcement of subsidy law and a way to ensure standards stay up to date. British negotiators will hope Mr Johnson will convince Mrs von der Leyen to begin intensive and secret \u201ctunnel talks\u201d in the run up to the October 15 EU summit. &quot;On fisheries the gap between us is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU risks being impossible to bridge,&quot; warned David Frost, the UK&#39;s chief negotiator after the ninth round of talks. A British compromise offer of a three year transition period for fishing quotas, with the UK share increasing over time, fell short of EU expectations this week. France, in particular, is pushing hard for a permanent quota system. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s negotiator, said there had been &quot;positive new developments&quot; in police cooperation and aviation safety but &quot;persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union.&quot; Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, said, &quot;As long as negotiations are ongoing I remain optimistic [...] It will be a crucial phase over the next few days.&quot; \u201cThe EU needs to hear at the highest level that the UK government is serious about a deal,\u201d one diplomatic source said. Getting a deal finalised by the end of October would give the EU time to ratify the deal before January 1 and avoid no deal, which would mean trading on less lucrative WTO terms.<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/boris-johnson-ursula-von-der-080925574.html","pubDate":"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 04:09:25 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"boris-johnson-ursula-von-der-080925574.html","hash":"7348dd180df2653cfff7b3c3c018380e","timestamp":1601683765}

This excerpt from His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life, by Jonathan Alter, explores Carter\u2019s contacts with President George H.W. Bush and President Barack Obama, all three of whom Alter interviewed for his biography.It was no secret that Carter was not a member in good standing of the ex-presidents\u2019 club, in part because he never accepted their code. The unwritten rules aren\u2019t complicated: Until the Trump era, former presidents were expected to build their libraries and at least try to hold their tongues about the incumbent, not complain\u2014as Carter often did\u2014that the policy is wrong or they are underused by the president. No one sitting in the Oval Office likes the idea of a freelance secretary of state. The challenge for them was managing their high-maintenance predecessor.After George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988, Secretary of State James Baker consulted Carter often. Carter helped Bush out in Panama in 1989 by confronting Manuel Noriega after he rigged an election. He told the dictator and his henchmen, \u201cYou are thieves.\u201d But his most conspicuous early diplomatic success was in Nicaragua, which he visited eight times in a five-year period.In February 1990, for the first time since the Russian Revolution, a Communist regime (the Sandinistas) lost a democratic election. If the shocking results held, Violeta Chamorro, a newspaper publisher, would replace President Daniel Ortega and become the first female head of state in the Americas.But five decades had passed since the last peaceful transfer of power in Nicaragua, and this one was by no means assured. Ortega had been confident of reelection\u2014all the polls showed him well ahead\u2014and he was not inclined to relinquish power. The Carter Center monitored the election, and, after finding it fair, Carter met with Ortega late into the night. He told Ortega, who had followed the familiar trajectory of dashing revolutionary to repressive thug, that he knew what it felt like to lose and that he could perhaps make a comeback someday. (He did.) Carter\u2019s personal experience in 1980 impressed Ortega, and he left office peacefully.President Bush was thrilled with Carter\u2019s role. \u201cThis sent a powerful message throughout the region and to Moscow,\u201d he recalled. Later, Carter resolved devilishly complex disputes between the Sandinistas and those whose property they had seized during their revolution.In the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War, Carter\u2019s relationship with Bush turned sour. Carter felt passionately that Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait wasn\u2019t worth going to war over, even though Bush cited the 1980 Carter Doctrine (which decreed that the U.S. had vital interests in the Persian Gulf) in justifying it. The former president said so publicly, then took matters a fateful step further, writing each member of the UN Security Council and urging them to vote against the United States on the resolution authorizing coalition forces to intervene. Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney received Carter\u2019s letter and alerted the Bush White House. Carter argued that there was no difference between expressing one\u2019s views publicly and privately. Bush, who recalled \u201cworking night and day\u201d to bring the allies aboard, vehemently disagreed. \u201cWe only have one president at a time,\u201d he said in 2016. He was appalled that a former president would \u201cfoment opposition to the policy objective of his own country.\u201d Even many Democrats felt Bush had the better argument.Carter didn\u2019t care about procedural niceties or whether Bush would stop liking him. When he was trying to keep the bullets from flying, his Plains friend Jill Stuckey explained, he never \u201cgave a rat\u2019s ass what people thought of him.\u201d Former Carter speechwriter Rick Hertzberg noted that Americans admire ruthlessness in the waging of war but not peace. Carter was \u201ca Patton of peace,\u201d Hertzberg said, referring to General George S. Patton, whose single-minded devotion to achieving his objectives during World War II was remembered longer than the harsh criticism he received from many contemporaries for improper behavior. Bush\u2019s apoplectic team briefly considered charging Carter with violation of the Logan Act, the 1799 federal law that criminalizes unauthorized negotiation with a foreign power.Bush himself was more merciful. After he won UN approval and liberated Kuwait, he dropped the matter. In 2006 Carter infuriated Bush again when he used his eulogy at Coretta Scott King\u2019s funeral to implicitly criticize President George W. Bush\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina the year before. Bush Sr. thought Carter\u2019s comments about his son were \u201cout of line and untrue,\u201d but at the end of his life, he made a point of saying, \u201cI respect this good man.\u201d* * *Just after the 2008 election, outgoing president George W. Bush invited all of the living former presidents to the White House for a private lunch with President-Elect Obama. A memorable Oval Office photograph shows the Bushes, Bill Clinton, and Obama chatting like old friends on the left, with Carter standing alone on the right. One of the presidents confided later that the photo perfectly captured the chemistry of their meeting and lunch that day. The other presidents gave Obama convivial advice on the peculiarities of the office, while Carter wanted to press his serious policy agenda. Carter later told Brian Williams of NBC News that the body language was deliberate because \u201cI feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other presidents.\u201d Judging by the amount of golf the others played over the years while Carter was doing good in Africa, this was an accurate but\u2014as he recognized\u2014ill-advised statement. The next day he tried to walk back the boast by saying he meant to refer to the \u201cgood deeds\u201d of the Carter Center.In October 2017 the five living former presidents, including new member Obama, gathered at Texas A&M University to raise money for hurricane relief. In the holding area, aides saw on their phones a column by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times entitled \u201cJimmy Carter Lusts for a Trump Posting.\u201d In it, Carter admitted that at Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2019s funeral, he had lobbied President Trump\u2019s (second of several) national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, to be dispatched to North Korea, and\u2014not coincidentally\u2014he refused to say anything negative about Trump. At the same time, he didn\u2019t hold back on his Democratic successors. Carter said that Obama \u201creneged\u201d on his early promise to work on Mideast peace and that he went overboard on authorizing drone strikes, especially in Yemen, a country that the always-adventurous Carter, late in life, called the most fascinating he had ever visited. (He even tried khat, a shrub used in the Horn of Africa as a stimulant.)During Obama\u2019s first term, neither the president nor Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had any interest in Carter\u2019s advice. He described his relationship with them as \u201cnonexistent,\u201d which, in the case of Obama, whom he had admired greatly in 2008, was personally hurtful. The fact that he and Obama had only ceremonial contacts embittered Carter and\u2014in his mind\u2014freed him to knock the president, as he had Clinton. Carter had known embattled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad since he was an ophthalmology student, and he publicly criticized Obama for issuing futile demands for Assad\u2019s removal. Obama\u2019s second-term secretary of state, John Kerry, was more solicitous of Carter and checked in regularly to see what he had learned about Syria peace plans in his meetings with Vladimir Putin and other leaders. Kerry found that even at ninety, Carter still had fresh information and penetrating insights into geopolitics.As he reflected on his own presidency, Obama came to feel that Carter had been misunderstood and deserved better from history. \u201cHe was mocked for the solar panels [that Carter placed on the roof of the White House in 1979] but he was prescient and he brought environmental concerns out of the counterculture and directly into U.S. policymaking,\u201d Obama said in 2020. \u201cHe introduced an explicit language around human rights and what previously had been an afterthought in foreign policy.\u201d Obama saw Carter as an important prod for his successors, who learned from him that \u201cit wasn\u2019t enough to talk about America as being a beacon for freedom as JFK or Ronald Reagan did, but that it had to mean something.\u201d And he found Carter\u2019s post-presidency inspiring: \u201cHis voice has meant a better life for many people around the world.\u201dFrom HIS VERY BEST: Jimmy Carter, a Life by Jonathan Alter.

Earlier this summer, an anonymous Instagram page that named and shamed a man accused of being a notorious sexual harasser at Egypt&#39;s most prestigious university was causing a sensation among her friends. Unknown to them, she was running it.The experiment started, in a flash of fury, in the dead of night. On July 1, Ashraf, a 22-year-old philosophy major, was up late to cram for an exam the next morning when she became preoccupied with the fate of a Facebook post that had mysteriously disappeared.Days earlier, a fellow student at the American University in Cairo had posted a warning on Facebook about a man she said was a sexual predator -- a brash, manipulative young man from a rich family said to be harassing and blackmailing women on campus. Now, Ashraf realized as she stared at her laptop, the post had been deleted without explanation.Enraged, she set aside her textbooks and created an Instagram page under a pseudonym -- @assaultpolice -- that identified the man, Ahmed Bassam Zaki, alongside his photo and a list of accusations of misdeeds against women.&quot;This guy had been getting away with stuff since the 10th grade,&quot; she said. &quot;Every time a woman opened her mouth, someone taped it shut. I wanted to stop that.&quot;After creating the page, Ashraf flopped into bed at 6 a.m. and slept through her exam. But when she awoke, she found hundreds of notifications from people who applauded her post and about 30 messages from women who confided that they, too, had been assaulted by Zaki. Some said they had been raped.An Egyptian MeToo moment was born.Within a week, Zaki had been arrested, the @assaultpolice account had amassed 70,000 followers, and the page had prompted an outpouring of testimonies from other Egyptian women fed up with being humiliated and violated.Sexual assault is endemic in Egypt -- a United Nations study in 2013 found that 99% of women had experienced harassment or violence -- but reporting it is notoriously difficult. Police officials are reluctant to register assault cases. Powerful institutions prefer to sweep accusations under the carpet. Even the families of victims, wary of scandal or feeling a misplaced sense of shame, tend to hush it up.Ashraf&#39;s bold page offered a new way.&quot;It was so wonderful,&quot; she recalled, sitting in her family home. &quot;A lot of the girls who got in touch said, &#39;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m finally being heard.&#39; Even though it was a dark time, here they were, speaking out. There was a sense of empowerment, of relief.&quot;On Sept. 1, authorities charged Zaki, 21, with three counts of sexual assault against underage women as well as multiple counts of blackmail and harassment. He remains in detention, awaiting trial.But then a second high-profile case came to light, also through Ashraf&#39;s Instagram page, that complicated matters. It promised to be even more sensational -- an account of a gang rape by five young men in a five-star hotel overlooking the Nile. In recent weeks, however, the case has become clouded in a murk of counteraccusations and leaked images that threatens to overshadow the progress Ashraf has made -- and possibly even reverse it.&quot;It&#39;s very worrisome,&quot; she said.Ashraf, 22, is not an archetypal Egyptian rebel. She comes from an apolitical family that lives in a gated community in eastern Cairo -- a place of manicured lawns and hushed streets lined with luxury vehicles where support for Egypt&#39;s authoritarian leader, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, runs relatively high.Her father owns a software company, her mother is a nutritionist, and her family stayed in the suburbs during the 2011 uprising that toppled Egypt&#39;s longtime ruler, Hosni Mubarak, and the 2013 protests that ushered in a military takeover and el-Sissi&#39;s rule.When the MeToo movement erupted in the United States in 2017, driven by accusations against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, she didn&#39;t pay much attention -- even if she did have her own experience of assault.When she was 11 years old, a delivery man carrying laundry approached her as she walked down the street and slapped her bottom. &quot;I had no idea why he was doing this,&quot; she said. &quot;It took me years to realize it was sexual.&quot;Public outrage over sexual assault has been growing in Egypt for about a decade, driven by high-profile attacks and, last year, harassment accusations against a famous soccer player. Even so, men continue to assault with impunity.Working-class women run a gantlet of harassment in crowded public buses, Ashraf said. Among the rich, although dating is tolerated, young men exploit their family connections to misbehave with license, she said, and many parents reflexively blame their daughters when things go wrong.&quot;The first response is that it&#39;s your fault,&quot; she said. &quot;How did he get your number? Why did you let him in?&quot;Ashraf initially shielded her activism from her parents, who thought she was locked in her bedroom to study. When she finally came clean to her father weeks later, he was alarmed. &quot;He went silent for three minutes,&quot; she recalled. &quot;Then he said, &#39;You can&#39;t tell anyone.&#39;&quot;Ashraf told him it was a little late for that.Is her brand of vigilantism open to abuse, or even fair? False accusations are a hazard, she admitted, adding that she tried to confirm the charges against Zaki through her network of friends. Even so, she had to delete one accusation, from his time as a business student in Spain, after it was found to be untrue.In a country like Egypt, such methods were necessary, she said. &quot;It&#39;s not like the West. You can&#39;t just walk into a police station.&quot;The real difficulties started, though, with the second high-profile case.In late July, Ashraf posted to Instagram about five men in their 20s, from wealthy families, who were said to have gang-raped a teenage woman in a suite at the Fairmont Nile City hotel after a party in 2014. A video of the assault, made by a sixth man, had been distributed to their friends.The accusation caused a sensation. Although Ashraf didn&#39;t identify the accused men, copycat accounts sprang up on Instagram that did. One is the son of a prominent steel tycoon; another is the son of a well-known soccer coach.Within one week the victim, who said her drink had been spiked by the assailants, approached police and pressed charges. In late August, Egypt&#39;s prosecutor general announced five arrests -- two men in Egypt and three in Lebanon, who have since been extradited to Egypt. At least three other men are being sought.But the investigation became muddied after investigators moved against several people who had come forward in connection to the case. Two men were accused of &quot;debauchery&quot; -- code for homosexuality -- based on photos found in their phones that were later leaked to the news media.They have been detained, as has a woman -- a former partner of one of those accused of rape -- whose intimate photos have been leaked onto the internet.Just who leaked those photos is unclear, and the cases are expected to come to court in the coming weeks. But they have already sent a chill through the ranks of Egyptian women who hoped it had become safer to report sexual violence.&quot;Fairmont has become our case of the century,&quot; Ashraf said. &quot;But it shouldn&#39;t be a precedent for assault cases. There&#39;s so many other things coming up that prove we are on the side of girls.&quot;After threats to her security, Ashraf suspended her Instagram page for 10 days in August. Now it is up and running again, but with a focus on educating women about their rights.&quot;You use the word &#39;consent&#39; all the time in English,&quot; she said. &quot;But I&#39;ve never heard its Arabic equivalent: taraadi. So we try to translate these concepts, break them down, explain.&quot;The only name she&#39;s made public of late is her own. Realizing that her identity was leaking out and fearing retribution from men who were threatened by the page, she decided it was safest to end her anonymity. &quot;I figured that if the bad guys knew who I was, good people should too,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#39;s protection in that.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/22-old-force-behind-egypts-190106448.html","pubDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 15:01:06 -0400","source":"The New York Times","guid":"22-old-force-behind-egypts-190106448.html","hash":"dc3db369a90017d263c37594de8c2388","timestamp":1601636466}

Sir John Holmes is understood to have been told by MPs that he cannot continue in the role \u2013 after seeking to extend his four-year term beyond December. The Electoral Commission is also now shelving plans to acquire powers to prosecute scores of criminal offences itself, rather than referring suspected breaches to the police and Crown Prosecution Service. It comes after the Conservatives raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the leadership and accountability of the watchdog, over the proposals, which Amanda Milling, the party chairman, said would have amounted to the body \u201cmarking its own homework\u201d. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph in August, Ms Milling said: \u201cThe commission should be focusing on improving its core functions, not trying to expand its empire. If the commission fails to make these changes and do the job it was set up to do then the only option would be to abolish it.\u201d This weekend, a commission spokesman said the body had \u201cpaused\u201d the move, stating that \u201cwe do not currently have broad stakeholder understanding and consent\u201d. Sir John, who has chaired the commission since 2017, faced criticism when this newspaper revealed in 2018 that, months after being nominated as the body\u2019s chairman, he said in a speech that he \u201cregret[ted] the result\u201d of the 2016 Brexit referendum and complained about \u201cthe panoply of Eurosceptic nonsense about the EU\u201d heard during the campaign. Brexiteers have repeatedly accused the commission of bias against pro-Leave campaigners. Sir John is understood to have informed the Speaker\u2019s committee on the Electoral Commission, which oversees the body, that he wished to continue in his role beyond the initial four-year term. His predecessor, Jenny Watson, served for two terms, totalling eight years. But the former civil servant\u2019s request was turned down after members of the panel concluded that \u201call is not well\u201d at the commission, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Last week, the committee began the process of appointing a replacement, with a public recruitment campaign expected to begin shortly. Under the Political Parties and Elections Act, the chairman cannot be a member of a political party, or anyone who has served as an MP or donated to a party in the last five years. Sir John gave the commissioners\u2019 endorsement to the push by Bob Posner, the body\u2019s chief executive, to hand itself powers to prosecute parties and campaign groups \u2013 now \u201cpaused\u201d. A spokesman for the commission said: \u201cWe thank him for his leadership of and commitment to the commission over the past four years and for all his work in support of the UK\u2019s democratic processes.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cWe planned to consult later this year on changes to our enforcement policy, which would have included a draft prosecution policy. However, while we have had positive discussions with a range of stakeholders, we do not currently have broad stakeholder understanding and consent. \u201cWe hope to build consensus in due course, but our current focus is to work to prepare for the polls taking place next May, to ensure that these elections can be delivered safely and effectively. We have therefore paused this work.\u201d<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/chairman-election-watchdog-forced-211257047.html","pubDate":"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 17:12:57 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"chairman-election-watchdog-forced-211257047.html","hash":"b6a562b66811f267e800177fcaca7432","timestamp":1601730777}

In a joint statement the two sides said that &quot;progress had been made in recent weeks&quot; but that &quot;significant gaps remained&quot;, including on the issue of fishing rights in UK waters. Mr Johnson is understood to have insisted that the UK was prepared to end the post-Brexit transition period without a formal trade agreement, as he warned that time was short to agree a deal. The UK has said it needs &quot;clarity&quot; by Oct 15 on whether a deal is possible. Last week it emerged that the UK had proposed a new three-year transition period for fisheries, in a bid to help unlock the talks. Over the course of the three-year period, the catches of EU fishermen would be gradually reduced before the implementation of new quotas.<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/exclusive-british-fishermen-unprepared-full-162213951.html","pubDate":"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 12:22:13 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"exclusive-british-fishermen-unprepared-full-162213951.html","hash":"4d78db9a60d071eb39ab3945b898e866","timestamp":1601713333}

Xi also urged Macau to seize the opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and Greater Bay Area projects.Chinese President Xi Jinping gives a speech in Macau to celebrate the 20-year anniversary of the former Portuguese colony&#39;s return to Chinese rule, on December 20, 2019.

Photo: BloombergMacau government projections show by 2040 the population is expected to increase by 18 per cent to 808,000 from 685,400 at present. This means the government has to act fast to maintain its per capita GDP of US$84,096, one of the world&#39;s highest, according to 2019 World Bank data.&quot;The upcoming retendering of the six casino concessionaires would be crucial to the development of Macau and take it to the next level,&quot; Allan Zeman, non-executive chairman at Wynn Macau, told the Post in an interview late last month.All six casino licence holders - Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts and Wynn Resorts from the US, Melco International Development and Galaxy Entertainment from Hong Kong, and Macau-based SJM Holdings, the gaming business of the late &quot;King of Gambling&quot; Stanley Ho - will see their concessions expire in June 2022. Macau hotels report rise in bookings for golden week holiday&quot;Gaming operators are looking at and working on [new projects],&quot; said Zeman. However, he added that the gaming operators are reluctant to commit wholeheartedly as there has been no word from the government on their licence renewal.&quot;I think once there is a green light, they will move forward,&quot; said Zeman, who is best known as the founder of Lan Kwai Fong, Hong Kong&#39;s nightlife district.Industry experts have long been critical of existing casino operators&#39; heavily reliance on high rollers from mainland China, with visitors from China accounting for more than 70 per cent of Macau&#39;s tourists.At present, nearly 80 to 90 per cent of the gaming revenue comes from the mainland, said Ben Lee, managing partner at IGamiX Management and Consulting. &quot;I don&#39;t think this is what the government intended to achieve when it opened up the casino monopoly [in 2001],&quot; he said, adding that the Macau government planned on it being more like Las Vegas, as an international tourism centre.Zeman, however, said that it was natural for Macau to get most of its visitors from China because of its proximity, 1.4 billion population and status as the only place outside the mainland where gambling is legal.He said that Las Vegas first started off with a focus on gambling for many years and eventually brought some top entertainment shows to its hotels to become a leading international tourism and gaming destination. He added that Macau has gone through a similar phase, and as the world&#39;s top gaming centre it now has the platform to become the world&#39;s No 1 entertainment centre by bringing the biggest names in the music industry and host major international sports events.Allan Zeman, chairman of the board at Wynn Macau, said the company is in the process of diversifying its entertainment offerings.

Photo: Winson WongZeman said Wynn Resorts was in the process of diversifying its entertainment offerings with the Crystal Pavilion at Wynn Palace, adding that construction on the project&#39;s initial phase will start in late 2021. &quot;Crystal Pavilion will become a unique world-class cultural destination, incorporating art, theatre and interactive installations, expansive food and beverage offerings, additional hotel rooms, and several signature entertainment features,&quot; according to Wynn&#39;s interim report.IGamiX&#39;s Lee said that to prevent &quot;bait and switch&quot; strategies, the Macau government will need a system for monitoring, enforcement and penalties should the casino operators fail to deliver on the promised non-gaming facilities after successfully winning the tender again in 2022.Macau badly needs these non-gaming facilities to attract international tourists to broaden its revenue sources as gaming income has declined for 12 straight months up to September. In the first nine months of the year, the sector&#39;s revenue fell 82 per cent to 38.6 billion patacas (US$4.8 billion), from 220.29 billion patacas a year ago, according to official data. Even the VIP segment which accounts for half of the sector&#39;s revenues, saw a 77 per cent decline in the first two quarters of the year, compared to a year earlier.This was inevitable considering tourist arrivals in Macau, whose historic city centre is a Unesco World Heritage Site, have tumbled 87 per cent to 3.57 million in the first eight months of the year because of border restrictions to prevent the spread of Covid-19, official figures show.As a result Macau&#39;s gross domestic product sank by 67.8 per cent year on year in the second quarter of 2020, the Statistics and Census Service said. As has been the case with economies around the world, the Macau government stepped in to help businesses and households affected by the Covid-19-induced downturn.&quot;With tourism being one of Macau&#39;s core economic pillars, the Macau government came up with financial stimulus packages, providing tax breaks and cash aid to affected companies and households as well as affected industries and employers to help revitalise the hard-hit economy,&quot; said Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of Macau&#39;s tourism office in a written reply.Carlos Siu Lam, associate professor at Centre for Gaming and Tourism Studies of Macao Polytechnic Institute, said that Macau should reduce its reliance on VIP gamers and expand its non-gaming offerings. &quot;With increased emphasis on the non-gaming sector, Macau will be able to draw different types of tourists, from young couples to families and even retirees,&quot; he said.Ho Iat-seng, Chief Executive of Macau, reiterated plans for a proposed stock exchange in the city during his policy address in April.

China&#39;s first-quarter trade with Lusophone countries reached US$31.97 billion, government data showed.In June, the Chinese government announced a plan to introduce a wealth management connect scheme which includes Macau financial firms. The scheme, which is yet to have a launch date, will allow bay area residents to buy investment products via banks in Hong Kong and Macau, while residents of Hong Kong and Macau can also invest in mainland investment products sold by the mainland banks.Similarly, there has not been much progress since last October when the Monetary Authority of Macau said it was conducting a feasibility study to establish a securities exchange. Besides, it has to compete with two established stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, which have about 4,700 listed companies and a combined market value of about US$10 trillion.Tourists at the ruins of St Paul&#39;s in Macau.

Photo: Nora TamMacau&#39;s Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng reiterated those plans in his policy address in April, saying the city is exploring ways to introduce a yuan-trading stock exchange and further develop its insurance and banking system. &quot;Macau and Guangdong would also look at the feasibility of building an international trade centre serving China and Portuguese-speaking countries to further their economic and trade ties,&quot; Ho added.The proposed Macau exchange will first focus on bond trading, Benjamin Chan Sau-san, chairman of Monetary Authority of Macau, the de facto central bank, said last year.How quickly the Macau government moves to implement the plan remains to be seen.&quot;Bond market makes sense for Macau, not a stock exchange, as it would not be competing with neighbouring stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen,&quot; said Patrick Rozario, managing director of accounting and advisory firm Moore Hong Kong, whose family is from Macau.The use of the yuan in Macau has grown substantially over the past one year, with cross border yuan trade settlement surging 23 per cent last year to 2.58 trillion yuan (US$378.44 billion) while yuan deposits rose 4 per cent to 55.97 billion patacas (US$7 billion), according to Monetary Authority of Macao data.Clement Chan, managing director of BDO, summed up Macau&#39;s predicament, saying the long-term success of Macau&#39;s diversification plan depends on whether it can define a role for itself as an offshore yuan trading centre and complement the two existing exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.&quot;It is a matter of finding a niche,&quot; he said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The Prime Minister and Ursula von der Leyen will hold their first conference call on Brexit since June \u201cto take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps,\u201d a Number 10 spokesman said. News of the video conference call came as the last scheduled round of UK-EU trade negotiations ended in Brussels. The pound rose by as much 0.5 percent on the hopes it would bring a breakthrough. &quot;Where there is a will, there is a way so I think we should intensify the negotiations,&quot; said Mrs von der Leyen, who will put the prime minister under pressure to soften the British position on access to UK waters after the end of the Brexit transition period. Mrs von der Leyen on Friday said neither side could afford no deal during the coronavirus pandemic. But she demanded concessions over level playing field commitments on state aid laws and the enforcement of the trade deal. She wants a stricter system of enforcement of subsidy law and a way to ensure standards stay up to date. British negotiators will hope Mr Johnson will convince Mrs von der Leyen to begin intensive and secret \u201ctunnel talks\u201d in the run up to the October 15 EU summit. &quot;On fisheries the gap between us is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU risks being impossible to bridge,&quot; warned David Frost, the UK&#39;s chief negotiator after the ninth round of talks. A British compromise offer of a three year transition period for fishing quotas, with the UK share increasing over time, fell short of EU expectations this week. France, in particular, is pushing hard for a permanent quota system. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s negotiator, said there had been &quot;positive new developments&quot; in police cooperation and aviation safety but &quot;persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union.&quot; Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, said, &quot;As long as negotiations are ongoing I remain optimistic [...] It will be a crucial phase over the next few days.&quot; \u201cThe EU needs to hear at the highest level that the UK government is serious about a deal,\u201d one diplomatic source said. Getting a deal finalised by the end of October would give the EU time to ratify the deal before January 1 and avoid no deal, which would mean trading on less lucrative WTO terms.<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/boris-johnson-ursula-von-der-080925574.html","pubDate":"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 04:09:25 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"boris-johnson-ursula-von-der-080925574.html","hash":"7348dd180df2653cfff7b3c3c018380e","timestamp":1601683765}

This excerpt from His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life, by Jonathan Alter, explores Carter\u2019s contacts with President George H.W. Bush and President Barack Obama, all three of whom Alter interviewed for his biography.It was no secret that Carter was not a member in good standing of the ex-presidents\u2019 club, in part because he never accepted their code. The unwritten rules aren\u2019t complicated: Until the Trump era, former presidents were expected to build their libraries and at least try to hold their tongues about the incumbent, not complain\u2014as Carter often did\u2014that the policy is wrong or they are underused by the president. No one sitting in the Oval Office likes the idea of a freelance secretary of state. The challenge for them was managing their high-maintenance predecessor.After George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988, Secretary of State James Baker consulted Carter often. Carter helped Bush out in Panama in 1989 by confronting Manuel Noriega after he rigged an election. He told the dictator and his henchmen, \u201cYou are thieves.\u201d But his most conspicuous early diplomatic success was in Nicaragua, which he visited eight times in a five-year period.In February 1990, for the first time since the Russian Revolution, a Communist regime (the Sandinistas) lost a democratic election. If the shocking results held, Violeta Chamorro, a newspaper publisher, would replace President Daniel Ortega and become the first female head of state in the Americas.But five decades had passed since the last peaceful transfer of power in Nicaragua, and this one was by no means assured. Ortega had been confident of reelection\u2014all the polls showed him well ahead\u2014and he was not inclined to relinquish power. The Carter Center monitored the election, and, after finding it fair, Carter met with Ortega late into the night. He told Ortega, who had followed the familiar trajectory of dashing revolutionary to repressive thug, that he knew what it felt like to lose and that he could perhaps make a comeback someday. (He did.) Carter\u2019s personal experience in 1980 impressed Ortega, and he left office peacefully.President Bush was thrilled with Carter\u2019s role. \u201cThis sent a powerful message throughout the region and to Moscow,\u201d he recalled. Later, Carter resolved devilishly complex disputes between the Sandinistas and those whose property they had seized during their revolution.In the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War, Carter\u2019s relationship with Bush turned sour. Carter felt passionately that Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait wasn\u2019t worth going to war over, even though Bush cited the 1980 Carter Doctrine (which decreed that the U.S. had vital interests in the Persian Gulf) in justifying it. The former president said so publicly, then took matters a fateful step further, writing each member of the UN Security Council and urging them to vote against the United States on the resolution authorizing coalition forces to intervene. Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney received Carter\u2019s letter and alerted the Bush White House. Carter argued that there was no difference between expressing one\u2019s views publicly and privately. Bush, who recalled \u201cworking night and day\u201d to bring the allies aboard, vehemently disagreed. \u201cWe only have one president at a time,\u201d he said in 2016. He was appalled that a former president would \u201cfoment opposition to the policy objective of his own country.\u201d Even many Democrats felt Bush had the better argument.Carter didn\u2019t care about procedural niceties or whether Bush would stop liking him. When he was trying to keep the bullets from flying, his Plains friend Jill Stuckey explained, he never \u201cgave a rat\u2019s ass what people thought of him.\u201d Former Carter speechwriter Rick Hertzberg noted that Americans admire ruthlessness in the waging of war but not peace. Carter was \u201ca Patton of peace,\u201d Hertzberg said, referring to General George S. Patton, whose single-minded devotion to achieving his objectives during World War II was remembered longer than the harsh criticism he received from many contemporaries for improper behavior. Bush\u2019s apoplectic team briefly considered charging Carter with violation of the Logan Act, the 1799 federal law that criminalizes unauthorized negotiation with a foreign power.Bush himself was more merciful. After he won UN approval and liberated Kuwait, he dropped the matter. In 2006 Carter infuriated Bush again when he used his eulogy at Coretta Scott King\u2019s funeral to implicitly criticize President George W. Bush\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina the year before. Bush Sr. thought Carter\u2019s comments about his son were \u201cout of line and untrue,\u201d but at the end of his life, he made a point of saying, \u201cI respect this good man.\u201d* * *Just after the 2008 election, outgoing president George W. Bush invited all of the living former presidents to the White House for a private lunch with President-Elect Obama. A memorable Oval Office photograph shows the Bushes, Bill Clinton, and Obama chatting like old friends on the left, with Carter standing alone on the right. One of the presidents confided later that the photo perfectly captured the chemistry of their meeting and lunch that day. The other presidents gave Obama convivial advice on the peculiarities of the office, while Carter wanted to press his serious policy agenda. Carter later told Brian Williams of NBC News that the body language was deliberate because \u201cI feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other presidents.\u201d Judging by the amount of golf the others played over the years while Carter was doing good in Africa, this was an accurate but\u2014as he recognized\u2014ill-advised statement. The next day he tried to walk back the boast by saying he meant to refer to the \u201cgood deeds\u201d of the Carter Center.In October 2017 the five living former presidents, including new member Obama, gathered at Texas A&M University to raise money for hurricane relief. In the holding area, aides saw on their phones a column by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times entitled \u201cJimmy Carter Lusts for a Trump Posting.\u201d In it, Carter admitted that at Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2019s funeral, he had lobbied President Trump\u2019s (second of several) national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, to be dispatched to North Korea, and\u2014not coincidentally\u2014he refused to say anything negative about Trump. At the same time, he didn\u2019t hold back on his Democratic successors. Carter said that Obama \u201creneged\u201d on his early promise to work on Mideast peace and that he went overboard on authorizing drone strikes, especially in Yemen, a country that the always-adventurous Carter, late in life, called the most fascinating he had ever visited. (He even tried khat, a shrub used in the Horn of Africa as a stimulant.)During Obama\u2019s first term, neither the president nor Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had any interest in Carter\u2019s advice. He described his relationship with them as \u201cnonexistent,\u201d which, in the case of Obama, whom he had admired greatly in 2008, was personally hurtful. The fact that he and Obama had only ceremonial contacts embittered Carter and\u2014in his mind\u2014freed him to knock the president, as he had Clinton. Carter had known embattled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad since he was an ophthalmology student, and he publicly criticized Obama for issuing futile demands for Assad\u2019s removal. Obama\u2019s second-term secretary of state, John Kerry, was more solicitous of Carter and checked in regularly to see what he had learned about Syria peace plans in his meetings with Vladimir Putin and other leaders. Kerry found that even at ninety, Carter still had fresh information and penetrating insights into geopolitics.As he reflected on his own presidency, Obama came to feel that Carter had been misunderstood and deserved better from history. \u201cHe was mocked for the solar panels [that Carter placed on the roof of the White House in 1979] but he was prescient and he brought environmental concerns out of the counterculture and directly into U.S. policymaking,\u201d Obama said in 2020. \u201cHe introduced an explicit language around human rights and what previously had been an afterthought in foreign policy.\u201d Obama saw Carter as an important prod for his successors, who learned from him that \u201cit wasn\u2019t enough to talk about America as being a beacon for freedom as JFK or Ronald Reagan did, but that it had to mean something.\u201d And he found Carter\u2019s post-presidency inspiring: \u201cHis voice has meant a better life for many people around the world.\u201dFrom HIS VERY BEST: Jimmy Carter, a Life by Jonathan Alter.

It will be funded entirely by members and supporters, not from the party&#39;s existing coffers, and will be open after the announcement.<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/red-wall-war-chest-offered-193602081.html","pubDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 15:36:02 -0400","source":"The Telegraph","guid":"red-wall-war-chest-offered-193602081.html","hash":"b41a50b63fbe39a4bbfd37704d78b0ab","timestamp":1601638562}

Earlier this summer, an anonymous Instagram page that named and shamed a man accused of being a notorious sexual harasser at Egypt&#39;s most prestigious university was causing a sensation among her friends. Unknown to them, she was running it.The experiment started, in a flash of fury, in the dead of night. On July 1, Ashraf, a 22-year-old philosophy major, was up late to cram for an exam the next morning when she became preoccupied with the fate of a Facebook post that had mysteriously disappeared.Days earlier, a fellow student at the American University in Cairo had posted a warning on Facebook about a man she said was a sexual predator -- a brash, manipulative young man from a rich family said to be harassing and blackmailing women on campus. Now, Ashraf realized as she stared at her laptop, the post had been deleted without explanation.Enraged, she set aside her textbooks and created an Instagram page under a pseudonym -- @assaultpolice -- that identified the man, Ahmed Bassam Zaki, alongside his photo and a list of accusations of misdeeds against women.&quot;This guy had been getting away with stuff since the 10th grade,&quot; she said. &quot;Every time a woman opened her mouth, someone taped it shut. I wanted to stop that.&quot;After creating the page, Ashraf flopped into bed at 6 a.m. and slept through her exam. But when she awoke, she found hundreds of notifications from people who applauded her post and about 30 messages from women who confided that they, too, had been assaulted by Zaki. Some said they had been raped.An Egyptian MeToo moment was born.Within a week, Zaki had been arrested, the @assaultpolice account had amassed 70,000 followers, and the page had prompted an outpouring of testimonies from other Egyptian women fed up with being humiliated and violated.Sexual assault is endemic in Egypt -- a United Nations study in 2013 found that 99% of women had experienced harassment or violence -- but reporting it is notoriously difficult. Police officials are reluctant to register assault cases. Powerful institutions prefer to sweep accusations under the carpet. Even the families of victims, wary of scandal or feeling a misplaced sense of shame, tend to hush it up.Ashraf&#39;s bold page offered a new way.&quot;It was so wonderful,&quot; she recalled, sitting in her family home. &quot;A lot of the girls who got in touch said, &#39;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m finally being heard.&#39; Even though it was a dark time, here they were, speaking out. There was a sense of empowerment, of relief.&quot;On Sept. 1, authorities charged Zaki, 21, with three counts of sexual assault against underage women as well as multiple counts of blackmail and harassment. He remains in detention, awaiting trial.But then a second high-profile case came to light, also through Ashraf&#39;s Instagram page, that complicated matters. It promised to be even more sensational -- an account of a gang rape by five young men in a five-star hotel overlooking the Nile. In recent weeks, however, the case has become clouded in a murk of counteraccusations and leaked images that threatens to overshadow the progress Ashraf has made -- and possibly even reverse it.&quot;It&#39;s very worrisome,&quot; she said.Ashraf, 22, is not an archetypal Egyptian rebel. She comes from an apolitical family that lives in a gated community in eastern Cairo -- a place of manicured lawns and hushed streets lined with luxury vehicles where support for Egypt&#39;s authoritarian leader, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, runs relatively high.Her father owns a software company, her mother is a nutritionist, and her family stayed in the suburbs during the 2011 uprising that toppled Egypt&#39;s longtime ruler, Hosni Mubarak, and the 2013 protests that ushered in a military takeover and el-Sissi&#39;s rule.When the MeToo movement erupted in the United States in 2017, driven by accusations against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, she didn&#39;t pay much attention -- even if she did have her own experience of assault.When she was 11 years old, a delivery man carrying laundry approached her as she walked down the street and slapped her bottom. &quot;I had no idea why he was doing this,&quot; she said. &quot;It took me years to realize it was sexual.&quot;Public outrage over sexual assault has been growing in Egypt for about a decade, driven by high-profile attacks and, last year, harassment accusations against a famous soccer player. Even so, men continue to assault with impunity.Working-class women run a gantlet of harassment in crowded public buses, Ashraf said. Among the rich, although dating is tolerated, young men exploit their family connections to misbehave with license, she said, and many parents reflexively blame their daughters when things go wrong.&quot;The first response is that it&#39;s your fault,&quot; she said. &quot;How did he get your number? Why did you let him in?&quot;Ashraf initially shielded her activism from her parents, who thought she was locked in her bedroom to study. When she finally came clean to her father weeks later, he was alarmed. &quot;He went silent for three minutes,&quot; she recalled. &quot;Then he said, &#39;You can&#39;t tell anyone.&#39;&quot;Ashraf told him it was a little late for that.Is her brand of vigilantism open to abuse, or even fair? False accusations are a hazard, she admitted, adding that she tried to confirm the charges against Zaki through her network of friends. Even so, she had to delete one accusation, from his time as a business student in Spain, after it was found to be untrue.In a country like Egypt, such methods were necessary, she said. &quot;It&#39;s not like the West. You can&#39;t just walk into a police station.&quot;The real difficulties started, though, with the second high-profile case.In late July, Ashraf posted to Instagram about five men in their 20s, from wealthy families, who were said to have gang-raped a teenage woman in a suite at the Fairmont Nile City hotel after a party in 2014. A video of the assault, made by a sixth man, had been distributed to their friends.The accusation caused a sensation. Although Ashraf didn&#39;t identify the accused men, copycat accounts sprang up on Instagram that did. One is the son of a prominent steel tycoon; another is the son of a well-known soccer coach.Within one week the victim, who said her drink had been spiked by the assailants, approached police and pressed charges. In late August, Egypt&#39;s prosecutor general announced five arrests -- two men in Egypt and three in Lebanon, who have since been extradited to Egypt. At least three other men are being sought.But the investigation became muddied after investigators moved against several people who had come forward in connection to the case. Two men were accused of &quot;debauchery&quot; -- code for homosexuality -- based on photos found in their phones that were later leaked to the news media.They have been detained, as has a woman -- a former partner of one of those accused of rape -- whose intimate photos have been leaked onto the internet.Just who leaked those photos is unclear, and the cases are expected to come to court in the coming weeks. But they have already sent a chill through the ranks of Egyptian women who hoped it had become safer to report sexual violence.&quot;Fairmont has become our case of the century,&quot; Ashraf said. &quot;But it shouldn&#39;t be a precedent for assault cases. There&#39;s so many other things coming up that prove we are on the side of girls.&quot;After threats to her security, Ashraf suspended her Instagram page for 10 days in August. Now it is up and running again, but with a focus on educating women about their rights.&quot;You use the word &#39;consent&#39; all the time in English,&quot; she said. &quot;But I&#39;ve never heard its Arabic equivalent: taraadi. So we try to translate these concepts, break them down, explain.&quot;The only name she&#39;s made public of late is her own. Realizing that her identity was leaking out and fearing retribution from men who were threatened by the page, she decided it was safest to end her anonymity. &quot;I figured that if the bad guys knew who I was, good people should too,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#39;s protection in that.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=\"all\">","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/22-old-force-behind-egypts-190106448.html","pubDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 15:01:06 -0400","source":"The New York Times","guid":"22-old-force-behind-egypts-190106448.html","hash":"dc3db369a90017d263c37594de8c2388","timestamp":1601636466}
